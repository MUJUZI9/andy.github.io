<h1>E-learning</h1>
<p>E-learning is a process of using computer related technologies and applications to study. In makerere we used e-
learning fully after the arrial of sanctions and restrictions in the world due to the emmergence of Covid-19.
e-learning in makerere was comprised of using softwares like makerere university e-learning environment (MUELE) and zoom which the students and lecturers used to learn and teach respectively.
The experience had so much to offer as the students learned how to solve network based problems and adapt to a new format of learning. as they were used to the traditional ways of learning that involved physical interaction between the leacturers and students.</p> 
<p>
E-learning opened up a faster and broader way  in which to enrich students with knowledge and as such the lectureres used a blended system of education where they used both the old system of teaching(physical interaction) and e-learning in order to deliver services onto the students at makerere. The system of blended learnig caught on so well to an extent that even when the restrictions were removed some lecturers and students still opted for the virtual e-learning type of education due to its convenience and adaptability into their day to day lives post the covid-19 crisis.</p>
